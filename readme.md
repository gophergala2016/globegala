#### Notes

Github doesn't provide lat, lng. Instead it provides city/country name. Globegala placed people according to there city/country centers. 
Some of the contributors do not have there location set in Github. We placed them in our `Gopher Treasure Hunt` event.
We don't use Github Real-time API. Your changes won't effect that instance also response is cached.
